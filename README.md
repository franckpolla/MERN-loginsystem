# MERN Login System üë®‚Äçüíª

Welcome to the MERN Login System project! This project provides a full-stack authentication system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) along with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

## Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out securely. It provides a seamless authentication experience using JWT tokens, ensuring secure transmission of user credentials. The frontend is built with React.js, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB is used as the database for storing user information.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Signup**: Users can create a new account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Login**: Existing users can log in using their email and password.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication using JWT tokens to protect user credentials.
- **Logout**: Users can securely log out of their accounts.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various authentication scenarios.
- **Responsive Design**: Responsive frontend design to support different screen sizes.
